# Sentiment-Analysis | NLP

##Goal 
To create a robust machine learning model utilizing natural language processing (NLP) that analyzes user-uploaded reviews to determine their sentiment (positive or negative) and generates appropriate responses accordingly.

##Dataset
I employed reviews sourced from a restaurant website to train my model and was pleasantly surprised to discover its remarkable performance, even when handling reviews unrelated to the restaurant domain.

##Overview 
________________________________________________________________________________________________
* I leveraged NLTK to conduct preprocessing, eliminating stopwords (words that do not contribute to sentiment analysis) while also removing non-alphabetic symbols and numbers. Subsequently, all text was transformed to lowercase for consistency.

* Utilizing a bag-of-words model, I extracted the top 1530 most frequent words and employed them to visualize a wide range of reviews. Subsequently, I converted the extracted words into a numpy array, facilitating future training.

* I trained the Naive Bayes model by feeding it the reviews as a numpy array. Following the training phase, I utilized the model for prediction, incorporating conditional statements to generate responses based on the analysis conducted.
